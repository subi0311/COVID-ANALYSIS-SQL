# COVID-ANALYSIS-SQL
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using SQL to extract meaningful insights about the pandemic. The dataset includes information on infection rates, death rates, vaccination progress, and other key metrics. By querying the data, I have uncovered trends, patterns, and insights that help in understanding the impact of COVID-19 globally and regionally.
