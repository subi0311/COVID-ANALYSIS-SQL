# COVID Analysis SQL

This project performs an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights about infection rates, death percentages, population impact, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

The analysis is based on two datasets from the `PortfolioProject` database:

- `covid_deaths$`: Contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and date-wise breakdown by location.
- `covid_vaccination$`: Contains vaccination details such as daily new vaccinations.
